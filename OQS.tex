Given a set of real numbers $\Omega$ with cardinality $N$ and allowed $K$ level quantization, the goal is to find out the optimal quantization division $\{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_{K-1}\}$ for this set. Without the loss of generality, we assume that all real numbers in $\Omega$ is in $[0, 1]$.
\begin{align}
\sum_{x\in \Omega} \sum_{k=1}^K {\bf 1}_k(x)V_k(x)
\end{align}
